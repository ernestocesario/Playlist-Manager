# Playlist-Manager

This is my project in Assembly ARM64 written for the Computer Architecture course assignment in May 2022 at the university.

The project is a Playlist Manager with a graphical console interface, with which you can manage multiple music playlists saved on files and perform various operations on each of them, such as adding, removing, searching and randomly shuffling, music taken from input. 

You can try this project on any machine using an emulator.
